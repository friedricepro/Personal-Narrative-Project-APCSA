Prompt : Hey chatgpt, im trying to make it so that my method displays the number of the favorite pokemon 
using the variable row,but it's always 1 below, is there any way I can change this? (insert drawAllPokemon method code)

Response :  drawText("Fav Pokemon #" +(row + 1), 100, 50); 
told me to put the row in parenthesis with the +1 to fix the 1 off
